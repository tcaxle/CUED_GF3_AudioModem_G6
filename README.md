## Setup
To run the code on your system, you need to have (python)[https://www.python.org/] and (pip)[https://pypi.org/project/pip/] installed.

Once you have this, run the following commands from the root of the repository:

* Install virtualenv to allow you to use virtual python environments:
```
# pip install --user virtualenv
```
* Create a virtual environment called `env`:
```
# virtualenv env
```
* Activate the environment:
	* Linux (BASH):
	```
	# source env/bin/activate
	```
	* Windows (cmd.exe):
	```
	> Scripts\activate.bat
	```
