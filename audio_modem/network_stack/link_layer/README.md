# Link Layer
_Sometimes called the "Data Link Layer"_

> The data link layer provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.
